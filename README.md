# Simple_interest
C++ program to calculate the Simple Interest, using the Principle amount, Rate of Interest & Time Period obtained from the user.

**Description:**
This C++ program calculates simple interest based on user input. Simple interest is the interest earned on a principal amount over a specified period of time at a fixed interest rate. The formula for calculating simple interest is: Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100.

The program prompts the user to input the principal amount, the interest rate, and the time period in years. It then performs the necessary calculations using the formula and displays the resulting simple interest.

**Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:**

**1. Include necessary header files**:
   - `#include <iostream>`: For input and output operations.
   - `using namespace std;`: To avoid having to write `std::` before standard library functions.

**2. Declare variables:**
   - `principle_amount`: To store the principal amount.
   - `rateOfinterset`: To store the interest rate.
   - `time_period`: To store the time period.
   - `simpleInterest`: To store the calculated simple interest.

**3. Prompt the user for input:**
   - Display a message asking the user to enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.
   - Use `cin` to read these values from the user.

**4. Calculate simple interest:**
   - Apply the formula: `simpleInterest = (principal_amount * rateOfinterest * time_period) / 100;`.

**5. Display the result:**
   - Output the calculated simple interest to the user.

**6. End of the program.**
